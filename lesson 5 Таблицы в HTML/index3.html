                <h1>William Shakespeare</h1>
                <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
                <p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor,
                    widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.
                    He is
                    often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including
                    collaborations,
                    consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses,
                    some
                    of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are
                    performed more often than those of any other playwright.
                </p>
                <p>Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married
                    Anne
                    Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between
                    1585
                    and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing
                    company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613),
                    he
                    appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's
                    private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his
                    physical
                    appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were
                    written
                    by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records
                    survive of
                    most commoners of the period.
                </p>
                <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily
                    comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until
                    about
                    1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered
                    to
                    be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote
                    tragicomedies
                    (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.
                </p>
                <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his
                    lifetime.
                    However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
                    published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of
                    Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a
                    poem
                    by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an
                    age,
                    but for all time".
                </p>
                <p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and
                    rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are
                    studied,
                    performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world.
