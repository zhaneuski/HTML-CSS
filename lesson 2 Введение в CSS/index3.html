    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p class="align"><span class="background">ax + b = 0</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="variable">a</span> and <span class="variable">b</span> are real numbers and <span
            class="variable">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
        equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be
        an <span class="variable">x</span>
        so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="variable">x</span> there.</p>
    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p class="align"><span class="background"> ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="variable">a</span>, <span class="variable">b</span>, <span class="variable">c</span> are
        known values and <span class="variable">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it
        yet). Also, <span class="variable">a</span> can't
        be 0.</p>
    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
    <p><span class="variable">&#960;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="variable">r</span>) squared:</p>
    <p class="align"><span class="background">A = &#960; &#215; r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="variable">D</span>):</p>
    <p class="align"><span class="background">A = ( &#960; / 4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup> </span>
    </p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="variable">C</span>) :</p>
    <p class="align"><span class="background">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &#960; </span></p>
    <h3>Intersection</h3>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="variable">A</span> and <span class="variable">B</span>, denoted by A
        &#8745; B, is the set of all objects that are
        members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    <p class="align"><span class="background"> A &#8745; B = { x : x &#8712; A and x &#8712; B
            } </span></p>
    <p>That is, <span class="variable">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and
        only if <span class="variable">x</span> is both an element of <span class="variable">A</span> and an element of
        <span class="variable">B</span>.
    </p>
