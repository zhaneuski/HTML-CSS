    <h1>Vehicle</h1>
    <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<span class="top">[1]</span>) is a machine that transports
        people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed
        vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft),
        aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<span class="top">[2]</span></p>
    <p id="boreder">Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
        wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for
        road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<span class="top">[3]</span></p>
