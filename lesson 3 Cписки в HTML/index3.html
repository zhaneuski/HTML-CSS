            <h2>TAG</h2>
            <p class="text1">In information systems, a tag is a keyword or term assigned to a piece of information (such
                as an
                Internet bookmark, digital image, database record, or computer file). This kind of metadata helps
                describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching.<sup>[1]</sup> Tags are
                generally chosen
                informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system, although they
                may also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
        </li>

            <h2>ATTRIBUTE</h2>
            <p class="text1">HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's
                behaviour. HTML
                attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default
                functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function
                correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.
            </p>
        </li>

            <h2>ELEMENT</h2>
            <p class="text1">An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document
                or web
                page.[vague] HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have HTML
                attributes specified. Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML nodes
                represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the &lt;title&gt; node represents the title of the
                document.
